I hear it's full of bones and probably needs plenty of prep to get it boneless. Props. It's one thing I would pay more to eat. | I would love to have that meal. Eel is one of my faves. | Eel is delicious, and I often used to eat it at Japanese restaurants. But because of overfishing, both American eel and Japanese eel are classed as *endangered* species, and European eel is *critically endangered.* | Its my favorite food. Love it bbq with a little char. | Mmmmmmm\\n\\n![gif](giphy|JOe7JxOiMg61ogl6fH)\\n\\n\\-don | Love Unagi | I‚Äôve never had eel. Man this looks delicious | I love unagi but I stopped eating it due to the shitty sustainability and farming practices.  Did you know they don't even know how eels mate/reproduce!?  They can't get them to do it in captivity | That looks delicious. ü§§ | I love eel, but sometimes it feels spiky in my mouth. Does anyone else get this or am I just a freak??? | That looks incredible | Yummy | This must have been expensive af! | Wow looks amazing | My favorite meal! With chopper green onions on top *chef's kiss* | My fave sushi rolls. | The Japanese know how to do food ü§§ | yumm | I fucking LOVE eel sauce and eel. Genuinely phenomenal | Looks so good | holy shit this is legit my favorite item of food. looks perfect. | I've never had it, but I'd sure try it based on the picture alone | Cor, they weren't skimping on the eel. | I would shamelessly devour this whole plate | I'm actually having that tonight. Unagi is soooo good | Yes, there are many small bones in the eel, so the price is high, and the bones are also picked out by hand. | If you're in New York you can eat it right now lol | How does it taste? | I can get it from at least four different places where I live in Indiana, I can't imagine there's no options wherever you are | It is. Eel just kinda melts in your mouth. So it's like little crispy sticky sweet charry bits around butter that has a hint of savory fishy flavor. | If you eat good kabayaki eel, you can taste the delicate texture of the eel and the charred skin soaked in the sauce. | It's the bones and most places don't pick them out since it's extremely time consuming. | If you're a freak, I am too bc I definitely get that spikey sensation almost every time | I‚Äôve always thought that eel is a bit expensive relative to other ingredients available at that price point but I would expect that box to be around 25-35 USD at the higher end.</td>\n",

(saving this post and hope to try this one day) | Looks great! \\n\\nWatched it being made in Sorrento, Italy and the secret is good quality produce and love - I‚Äôm sure yours was excellent! | What do you do with the zested lemons? | Need to make a beef Wellington and Ratatouille next. | Does anyone (or OP) know the name of those types of bottles?

I wouldn‚Äôt say no :) | looks so good! | Ooh! Did you actually ferment the lemon juice or did u do the traditional rind in vodka soaking? | Where did you buy that lemon jar :) | Love the jar so much | Nothing better than a homemade Limoncello | I start with 190. Cut it with 1.5 x simple syrup (1/1 mix). I think your version is much, much stronger than 60 proof. | Eyeball tighteners üòã | Send me some ;) | Yum - looks so good - also love your labels. | What is the ratio of infused everclear to simple syrup to achieve 60 proof? | What did you do with the rest of the lemons? Do they keep okay in the fridge for a few days without a peel? Trying to think what I would do with so many lemons, other than making lemonade. | I dream of having a lemon tree and doing this. üòç Maybe one day. | I fully appreciate the personalized labeling.  This is the way | It's so bright compared to the commercial stuff!  I dunno how much is the lighting, but it looks almost like orange juice. | I know we‚Äôre in r/food but how did you make your labels?? | I made a Sous Vide limoncello a couple months ago, came out really nicely. I want to try making it again with Everclear instead of vodka next | by tinctured, does that just mean \"let the peels sit in the everclear\" for 35 days?\\n\\nand then after removing the peels, mixing the everclear and simple syrup and letting it sit 7 more days?\\n\\ndoes it need to be any specific temp, or can i just plop it in the garage for 6 weeks?\\n\\n  \\nthanks, looks incredible and i want to give it a shot | Looks like an AZ backyard where I used to do the same | nice touch with the label üëå | Looks neatly refined, couldn't even tell it was homemade | You can make a really great limoncello in a few hours with a sous vide.\\n\\nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/fast-limoncello-recipe-1327729 | I want to try | Well done on the process. Mine and most people's favorite of the various 'cello experiments I've made is Lemon-Tangerine-Grapefruit.¬†\\n\\n\\nTangerine zest have better flavor than oranges for some reason, and you get more zest per pound of fruit depending on varieties[I microplane, but I've never tried cutting the zest off smoothing that small and squishy. The grapefruit oils give you that light numbing tingling on the edges of your palate, depending on the amount in the ratio used, that is quite nice.¬†¬† | yellow | Mmm | Looks amazing and I love those labels! | Acceptable!! | i love this, have done with oranges too (get untreated ones or organic ones): yours look great |  Food is a way to a man‚Äôs heart and therefore we got to pin down with our lovely delicacies | Love me a good Limoncello! | you can make pasta now | It looks great, nice work! | Any alcohol in it | Thanks! Very fresh lemon flavor is coming through, definitely dangerous as you know there is booze in there but it‚Äôs well balanced and nice to sip. Likely sitting around 60 proof | Your grandfather seems like a great man. I would have done the same lol | They did the math! This probably right, google led me astray | Everclear is 190 proof, not 151. Also, the sugar does add volume to the simple syrup so it‚Äôs more than 4 cups of liquid by the end - probably closer to 5 cups than 4.\\n\\n\\nWith those numbers, I‚Äôm coming up with roughly 113 proof (56.5%). | Would the soaking the peels take away some of the alcohol %?  Could that be how it gets to 60 proof?  \\n\\nI know nothing about any of this ‚Ä¶ just curious. | Grazie mille! | In most cases yes, you would do an equal part sugar to water, however, in this amount, 4 cups of sugar would make the limoncello too sweet and over powering. Less is more in this case. | Commercial simple syrup tends to be equal parts, but they also have preservatives.\\n\\nPeople who make it at home go anywhere from 1:1 to even 2:1 sweetener to water ratio.\\n\\nOne of the benefits to more sugar in the ratio is it sugar helps the syrup last longer by inhibiting mold growth. Obviously that's not as big a deal if you're mixing the whole batch with alcohol right away, but if you're storing any a while it helps. I use 2 parts sugar to water when I make demarura brown sugar syrup because I have to special order the sugar and I don't go through it fast.\\n\\nI use 1.5 sugar to water for plain simple syrup because I don't want to have to make batches as often, so concentrating it a bit more than average let's me store more per bottle.\\n\\nIt really just depends on what you're trying to do. | Early Congratulations to you!! | They are Lisbon Lemons! | We juice them and freeze them in ice cube trays and pop them out through the year when we need lemon juice | I‚Äôve made a beef Welly before! Just need to make Ratatouille, it‚Äôs on the list\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67hftges8vre1.jpeg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca341dc2fbfe66a2086430187749be58c36fc208 | Yes, they are Swing Top bottles | Grazie mille! | Thank you! | Went the traditional route with the rinds! | To be honest I have no idea, I asked my wife if we had a large jar at home for like lemonade while at the store, she said yes don‚Äôt buy one.

Possibly how fresh it was from when I picked the lemons off the tree to the same day starting the lemoncello | 60 proof is what I estimate, started with 151, yes‚Äôs will get you celloed up</td>\n",

Super simple\\n\\nSalt the fish and start the rice. \\n\\nIn a deep pan, saut√© a few smashed cloves of garlic, some fresh grated ginger, lemongrass (about 2 tbsp of paste or a whole stem cut up in 2‚Äô and smashed) and some Thai red peppers. Be careful with them, they are pungent. If you‚Äôre not a fan of heat use Thai red curry paste - it still has some chili in it but it‚Äôs not nearly as hot as the peppers, you can feel the spice on your face when you‚Äôre cutting those. Add a can of coconut milk and let simmer. If you want a more loose broth you can add a cup of water or stock (chicken/fish or veggie - I‚Äôve tried all and it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference). After maybe like 10 minutes, strain the aromatics out. Add about a teaspoon of fish sauce and load your cod in, cover with a lid. \\n\\nWhile everything cooks prep your veggies. I chopped up some bok choy, asparagus and snow peas. Any green garnish works too - today I had scallions and basil on hand so I added that. Let the fish cook about 8-10 minutes, more if there‚Äôs a lot of fish. I had .9 lbs. I add my veggies in after I turn off the stove because I like vibrant and crunchy veggies. I added mango &amp; pineapple salsa on top because I had some on hand but that‚Äôs not necessary. \\n\\nYou can serve it in a soup form or plate it like I did for my fianc√©.  \\n\\nI‚Äôd add some kaffir lime leafs if I had any on hand, you can sub for lime zest too at the very end for a refreshing zing. I didn‚Äôt have either tonight so I squeezed a little lemon on top - not as great but still good!

I hear it's full of bones and probably needs plenty of prep to get it boneless. Props. It's one thing I would pay more to eat. | I would love to have that meal. Eel is one of my faves. | Eel is delicious, and I often used to eat it at Japanese restaurants. But because of overfishing, both American eel and Japanese eel are classed as *endangered* species, and European eel is *critically endangered.* | Its my favorite food. Love it bbq with a little char. | Mmmmmmm\\n\\n![gif](giphy|JOe7JxOiMg61ogl6fH)\\n\\n\\-don | Love Unagi | I‚Äôve never had eel. Man this looks delicious | I love unagi but I stopped eating it due to the shitty sustainability and farming practices.  Did you know they don't even know how eels mate/reproduce!?  They can't get them to do it in captivity | That looks delicious. ü§§ | I love eel, but sometimes it feels spiky in my mouth. Does anyone else get this or am I just a freak??? | That looks incredible | Yummy | This must have been expensive af! | Wow looks amazing | My favorite meal! With chopper green onions on top *chef's kiss* | My fave sushi rolls. | The Japanese know how to do food ü§§ | yumm | I fucking LOVE eel sauce and eel. Genuinely phenomenal | Looks so good | holy shit this is legit my favorite item of food. looks perfect. | I've never had it, but I'd sure try it based on the picture alone | Cor, they weren't skimping on the eel. | I would shamelessly devour this whole plate | I'm actually having that tonight. Unagi is soooo good | Yes, there are many small bones in the eel, so the price is high, and the bones are also picked out by hand. | If you're in New York you can eat it right now lol | How does it taste? | I can get it from at least four different places where I live in Indiana, I can't imagine there's no options wherever you are | It is. Eel just kinda melts in your mouth. So it's like little crispy sticky sweet charry bits around butter that has a hint of savory fishy flavor. | If you eat good kabayaki eel, you can taste the delicate texture of the eel and the charred skin soaked in the sauce. | It's the bones and most places don't pick them out since it's extremely time consuming. | If you're a freak, I am too bc I definitely get that spikey sensation almost every time | I‚Äôve always thought that eel is a bit expensive relative to other ingredients available at that price point but I would expect that box to be around 25-35 USD at the higher end.  \n",
       "1   nice job. looks great. how's the taste? (and the proof?) | Great job. My Italian grandfather always had mason jars of homemade limoncello in the freezer. My cousins and I would steal tiny sips when he was outside and we were in the house unsupervised. | Are you sure it's 60 proof?\\n\\n(1750*151) / (1750+950) ~= 98\\n\\nSo unless you lost more than half your alcohol somewhere or added more dilution, you should be closer to 100 than 60, no? | Bellisimo el resultado en las botellas , cada detalle es hermoso. Deben saber deliciosos | Isn't simple syrup normally equal parts sugar and water?  Were you just wanting less sweetness? | Nice one!  I kind making limoncello, though I haven't made any in a while.  Next month I'll be getting some 95% abv base spirit from a distiller friend of mine so I can have a batch ready in time for my wedding | What kind of lemons did you use? \\n\\nThis looks fantastic! (saving this post and hope to try this one day) | Looks great! \\n\\nWatched it being made in Sorrento, Italy and the secret is good quality produce and love - I‚Äôm sure yours was excellent! | What do you do with the zested lemons? | Need to make a beef Wellington and Ratatouille next. | Does anyone (or OP) know the name of those types of bottles? (I assume they do well to seal and I want to use for my homemade ginger syrup) | These reminds me of the limoncello they make along the Amalfi Coast! Bellissima!! I wouldn‚Äôt say no :) | looks so good! | Ooh! Did you actually ferment the lemon juice or did u do the traditional rind in vodka soaking? | Where did you buy that lemon jar :) | Love the jar so much | Nothing better than a homemade Limoncello | I start with 190. Cut it with 1.5 x simple syrup (1/1 mix). I think your version is much, much stronger than 60 proof. | Eyeball tighteners üòã | Send me some ;) | Yum - looks so good - also love your labels. | What is the ratio of infused everclear to simple syrup to achieve 60 proof? | What did you do with the rest of the lemons? Do they keep okay in the fridge for a few days without a peel? Trying to think what I would do with so many lemons, other than making lemonade. | I dream of having a lemon tree and doing this. üòç Maybe one day. | I fully appreciate the personalized labeling.  This is the way | It's so bright compared to the commercial stuff!  I dunno how much is the lighting, but it looks almost like orange juice. | I know we‚Äôre in r/food but how did you make your labels?? | I made a Sous Vide limoncello a couple months ago, came out really nicely. I want to try making it again with Everclear instead of vodka next | by tinctured, does that just mean \"let the peels sit in the everclear\" for 35 days?\\n\\nand then after removing the peels, mixing the everclear and simple syrup and letting it sit 7 more days?\\n\\ndoes it need to be any specific temp, or can i just plop it in the garage for 6 weeks?\\n\\n  \\nthanks, looks incredible and i want to give it a shot | Looks like an AZ backyard where I used to do the same | nice touch with the label üëå | Looks neatly refined, couldn't even tell it was homemade | You can make a really great limoncello in a few hours with a sous vide.\\n\\nhttps://www.thespruceeats.com/fast-limoncello-recipe-1327729 | I want to try | Well done on the process. Mine and most people's favorite of the various 'cello experiments I've made is Lemon-Tangerine-Grapefruit.¬†\\n\\n\\nTangerine zest have better flavor than oranges for some reason, and you get more zest per pound of fruit depending on varieties[I microplane, but I've never tried cutting the zest off smoothing that small and squishy. The grapefruit oils give you that light numbing tingling on the edges of your palate, depending on the amount in the ratio used, that is quite nice.¬†¬† | yellow | Mmm | Looks amazing and I love those labels! | Acceptable!! | i love this, have done with oranges too (get untreated ones or organic ones): yours look great |  Food is a way to a man‚Äôs heart and therefore we got to pin down with our lovely delicacies | Love me a good Limoncello! | you can make pasta now | It looks great, nice work! | Any alcohol in it | Thanks! Very fresh lemon flavor is coming through, definitely dangerous as you know there is booze in there but it‚Äôs well balanced and nice to sip. Likely sitting around 60 proof | Your grandfather seems like a great man. I would have done the same lol | They did the math! This probably right, google led me astray | Everclear is 190 proof, not 151. Also, the sugar does add volume to the simple syrup so it‚Äôs more than 4 cups of liquid by the end - probably closer to 5 cups than 4.\\n\\n\\nWith those numbers, I‚Äôm coming up with roughly 113 proof (56.5%). | Would the soaking the peels take away some of the alcohol %?  Could that be how it gets to 60 proof?  \\n\\nI know nothing about any of this ‚Ä¶ just curious. | Grazie mille! | In most cases yes, you would do an equal part sugar to water, however, in this amount, 4 cups of sugar would make the limoncello too sweet and over powering. Less is more in this case. | Commercial simple syrup tends to be equal parts, but they also have preservatives.\\n\\nPeople who make it at home go anywhere from 1:1 to even 2:1 sweetener to water ratio.\\n\\nOne of the benefits to more sugar in the ratio is it sugar helps the syrup last longer by inhibiting mold growth. Obviously that's not as big a deal if you're mixing the whole batch with alcohol right away, but if you're storing any a while it helps. I use 2 parts sugar to water when I make demarura brown sugar syrup because I have to special order the sugar and I don't go through it fast.\\n\\nI use 1.5 sugar to water for plain simple syrup because I don't want to have to make batches as often, so concentrating it a bit more than average let's me store more per bottle.\\n\\nIt really just depends on what you're trying to do. | Early Congratulations to you!! | They are Lisbon Lemons! | We juice them and freeze them in ice cube trays and pop them out through the year when we need lemon juice | I‚Äôve made a beef Welly before! Just need to make Ratatouille, it‚Äôs on the list\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67hftges8vre1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca341dc2fbfe66a2086430187749be58c36fc208 | Yes, they are Swing Top bottles | Grazie mille! | Thank you! | Went the traditional route with the rinds! | To be honest I have no idea, I asked my wife if we had a large jar at home for like lemonade while at the store, she said yes don‚Äôt buy one. Came home and this was it, said oh, that‚Äôs perfect | Sent! | Thanks! | I spent Friday afternoon making lemon syrup and lemon curd :) | We juice them and freeze them in ice cube trays, then pop them out through the year when we need lemon juice or if we want to make some lemonade | Thanks! Possibly how fresh it was from when I picked the lemons off the tree to the same day starting the lemoncello | 60 proof is what I estimate, started with 151, yes‚Äôs will get you celloed up  \n",

sauce homemade? If so I'd love to know how you made it! | Looks good! Try pickling some onions, takes it up a notch. | I made a paste out of some canola oil and citrus, and a curry blend consisting of: turmeric, red pepper, coriander, ginger, cumin, fenugreek, white pepper, cinnamon, fennel, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves and black pepper. \\n\\nAdded some other warming type spices as well. \\n\\nCan use any good mix for shawarma spices but typically a mix of Indian and kind of Turkish or Lebanese spice blends. (Sorry for any purists, please chime in with any authentic adjustments, I would love to alter this as necessary, but it‚Äôs great with any combo of spices in these areas). | It was made from components like curry spice blends, oils, squeezed citrus, and honestly the base was this nice spicy homemade roasted salsa I had on hand. Sounds crazy but the parts of that salsa work in this and help blend the marinade. \\n\\nYou can leave that out though and just blend good quality dried curry spices or freshly made curry spices in oil and some citrus and marinade 2-6 hours. Then grill carefully, flipping to keep a nice even char.  \n",

I would love to try it some day! | I wasn‚Äôt following anything in particular but here‚Äôs what I did. Super simple\\n\\nSalt the fish and start the rice. \\n\\nIn a deep pan, saut√© a few smashed cloves of garlic, some fresh grated ginger, lemongrass (about 2 tbsp of paste or a whole stem cut up in 2‚Äô and smashed) and some Thai red peppers. Be careful with them, they are pungent. If you‚Äôre not a fan of heat use Thai red curry paste - it still has some chili in it but it‚Äôs not nearly as hot as the peppers, you can feel the spice on your face when you‚Äôre cutting those. Add a can of coconut milk and let simmer. If you want a more loose broth you can add a cup of water or stock (chicken/fish or veggie - I‚Äôve tried all and it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference). After maybe like 10 minutes, strain the aromatics out. Add about a teaspoon of fish sauce and load your cod in, cover with a lid. \\n\\nWhile everything cooks prep your veggies. I chopped up some bok choy, asparagus and snow peas. Any green garnish works too - today I had scallions and basil on hand so I added that. Let the fish cook about 8-10 minutes, more if there‚Äôs a lot of fish. I had .9 lbs. I add my veggies in after I turn off the stove because I like vibrant and crunchy veggies. I added mango & pineapple salsa on top because I had some on hand but that‚Äôs not necessary. \\n\\nYou can serve it in a soup form or plate it like I did for my fianc√©.  \\n\\nI‚Äôd add some kaffir lime leafs if I had any on hand, you can sub for lime zest too at the very end for a refreshing zing. I didn‚Äôt have either tonight so I squeezed a little lemon on top - not as great but still good! You just need a light touch of acidity to bring everything together | All together about ~20 minutes.  \n",

                                                              we still make these at least once a month despite it being a day's work processing the \"meat\", making the gordita shells, and soaking and mashing the beans. thankfully they end up costing about $1 per taco rather than the insane $6 tbell currently sells them at, and we have leftovers for days. we made a couple pounds of beans this time and had crazy excess so one of the cgc's is a ...  cheesy bean gordita crunch. | The way cheesy Gordita crunches are the best thing on the menu and like $6 a piece always hurts. Looks good!! | Way to go bubba... that looks awesome. I miss the days of being able to feed an army at taco bell for $20... figuring out out to replicate at home is the way to go. When the prices started rising frequently and then they dropped the spicy tostada, meximelt, double decker, and the pizza (I know it's back now) all at once... I was done with taco bell... | started getting the art down at home. not having the convenience of a drive thru fucking sucks but i've finally gotten it damn near 1:1 flavor wise, so i'm not too upset.  \n",
